# Workouts for Imgur
A workout app that downloads public albums found at Imgur.com and transforms them into organized workouts.
Found on the Google Play Store at:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.johnnymolina.imgurworkout

### Why create this App?
After months spent self-learning java and becoming comfortable with Java I turned to my endgoal at the time: mastering the Android framework.
I set out to accomplish this and after perusing a multitude of tutorial videos, official doc readings, blogs, and github repo examples I came out with a better understanding of the Android Framework and SDK.

**One message stood out**: *the best way to learn is to actively create!* 

This app is the result of my first attempt to follow through the app development process all the way to publishing.

The app's current state is not reflective of my current accumulated Android experience as it *last received an update* **June 1, 2015**. 

#### Future Plans
For my Android Nanodegree's capstone project I plan to revamp this app with my updated standards including:
* Material Design
* Model-View-Presenter Architecture
* Lambda Expressions with RxJava (Reactive Extensions for the JVM)
* Dependency Injection
* Updated Realm database
* Handle Networking with Retrofit 
* Code Documentation
* Unit, Connected, and UI tests
